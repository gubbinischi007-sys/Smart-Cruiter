# Project Summary: Smart-Cruiter

## 1. Project Overview
**Smart-Cruiter** is a modern, full-stack **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** designed to streamline and automate the recruitment process. The application bridges the gap between hiring managers (HR) and job seekers (Candidates) by providing a centralized platform for job posting, application management, communication, and automated hiring workflows.

## 2. Problem Statement
Traditional recruitment processes are often fragmented, relying on manual email tracking, disparate spreadsheets, and slow communication cycles. This leads to:
- Missing out on top talent due to delays.
- Difficulties in tracking the status of multiple applicants.
- Lack of a centralized audit trail for hiring decisions.
- Poor candidate experience due to inconsistent feedback.

## 3. Objectives
The primary objectives of **Smart-Cruiter** are:
- **Centralization:** To provide a single source of truth for all recruitment data.
- **Automation:** To automate repetitive tasks like sending offer letters and status updates.
- **Transparency:** To allow candidates to track their application status in real-time.
- **Efficiency:** To reduce the "Time-to-Hire" by providing HR with clear metrics and tools for decision-making.

## 4. Key Features
- **Candidate Dashboard:** A personalized space for job seekers to view their applications and check for updates.
- **Communication Center:** An integrated inbox for candidates to receive and respond to job offers, interview invites, and rejections.
- **HR Management Portal:** Tools for HR to create job listings, review resumes, and manage the applicant pipeline.
- **Automated Offer Workflow:** One-click generation and delivery of offer letters with "Accept/Decline" functionality.
- **Interactive Metrics:** Data visualization of hiring stats (Active jobs, Total applicants, Hired count).
- **Audit History:** A comprehensive log of every hiring decision made, ensuring accountability.

## 5. Stakeholders
1.  **Administrative/HR Users:** Responsible for creating jobs and making hiring decisions.
2.  **Candidates:** Potential employees looking for opportunities and tracking their applications.

## 6. Conclusion
**Smart-Cruiter** demonstrates how modern web technologies (React, Node.js, and SQLite) can be combined to solve real-world business challenges. By focusing on user experience (UX) and process automation, it transforms the recruitment journey into a seamless, professional, and data-driven experience.
